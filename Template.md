# [Draft Title]
Start by writing down a draft title of your post. This will help frame the whole concept of the post.

**Brief Intro**
In this section, write a few sentences that will set the tone and direction for your post. For example, your draft intro could look something like this:
The way we communicate has changed. Now, conversations start around content.
Find Altimeter Group quote about Culture of Content
Find Social Media usage stats
By empowering employees to share content strategically, you’re investing in your employees, your brand, and consumer trust.
Add a few more thoughts…
Finish off the intro section with a question. This will help frame the next point.

## [Header #1: First Point]

This is your first segway into the hard-hitting point of your blog. After prefacing the post with your intro, use this section to write an initial point that leads to the meat of the article.
For example, after writing an introduction centered around content strategy across the enterprise, a first point might be something like “Content Serves A Purpose.” You would then proceed to write a couple paragraphs about how and why content serves a purpose.
Your last sentence should lead into your next post. Sometimes it’s easier to finish a section with a thought-provoking question.
[Header #2-4: Body]
The next few headers should lead readers through your different arguments that support the statements you make in your intro and first header. For example, if we continue with the flow of the intro and header #1 of “Content Serves A Purpose,” the following could be headers that would lead readers through a story:
Data Is Your Knowledge Source For Content
Sharing Knowledge And Insights With Your Team
Proceed with the same as your first point, and fill out the sections with a few paragraphs.
[Next Header: Main Point/Hitting Point]
This is the section of your body where you hit the readers with the main idea behind your post. This section is usually where you would add a bit of a soft sales pitch, or add something highly controversial. You want readers to react at to this point (think of it as an AHA! moment).
An example heading could be “The Knowledge Library – A Tool Designed For Your Employees.” This would be the main selling point of the article, based on the intro and headings presented above.
At the end of this section, finish off with a statement that reinforces the readers that they now understand the value behind your idea, but how do they do it. E.g. “Now you understand the value content can bring to your organization and employees. But what features would a Knowledge Library need?”

## [Heading: Actionable Tips]
After presenting the main ideas and theories for your post, it’s good to leave people with a few actionable tips. For stuff that’s a bit more proprietary, present tips in the form of questions.
To make this section easier to read, add one or two paragraphs at the start of the section, then present the tips in bullet points.
A few examples for headings in this section (following the headings presented previously) could be:
What Features Should A Knowledge Library Have?
What Content Should You Include In A Knowledge Library?
After presenting your bullets, finish off this section with a brief paragraph.

## [Closing Thoughts]
This section should briefly recap the main ideas of your post, but it isn’t meant to be a summary. Adding a provocative statement, your own opinion on the topic, a couple of examples (or case studies), etc., will help close of your post and make you look like a thought leader.

## [List of questions]
Always close of the post with 2-3 questions the readers should think about when they leave.

## [CTA]
Add some sort of call to action. If it’s a post meant to generate leads, you might want to add a button or a link to request a demo. If the post is a bit more on the thought leadership side, you might want to encourage people to leave a comment or feedback and ask them to share with colleagues.
